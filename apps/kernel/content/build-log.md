## July 2026 — Delegation Wired End-to-End, MCP Connectors & the Software-Factory Loop

**Acting-for delegation landed across the kernel, the MCP surface grew real connectors, and we built an autonomous sprint loop — human-gated by design.**

### 🔑 Delegation, canonicalized (#1088, #1114)

`resolveActingDid` became the one canonical precedence helper for "who is this action *for*" — wired through chat, connections, pay, notify, registry, and profile. Every delegated write now records the actor and the principal separately: the agent acts, the human owns, and the signed record says so honestly.

### 🔌 MCP connectors — one door, scoped by config (#1166, #1170, #1204)

- **OAuth 2.1 authorization server + an extensible `/mcp` surface** — one endpoint, connectors surface as projection surfaces behind it.
- **RFC 7591 Dynamic Client Registration** so real MCP clients (Claude Desktop) can connect without hand-provisioning.
- **Media read + write tools** with DID-scoped authorization — the agent can create and update content, always owner-pinned.
- **Userspace documents as the control plane (#1204→#1219):** scopes live as editable documents — grant-by-edit, revoke-by-delete — not hardcoded constants. First live production use: a sovereign GitHub connector path.
- **Claude promoted to a first-class actor DID (#1171)** — a machine identity that acts under consent, with its OAuth refresh-token chain revocable on app-authorization revoke.

### 🛡 Security surface hardened (#1247, #967, #966)

Route-aware `frame-ancestors` CSP + baseline security headers. Served `/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116), `/.well-known/fair-policy.json`, and an A2A Agent Card at `/.well-known/agent.json`. Partial refunds for multi-ticket orders (#949). Media API hardening — timing-safe auth, DB-backed search, dynamic tool bootstrap (#351).

### 🖥 Local inference — the 5090 came online

The inference node moved to an RTX 5090 (32GB). A working deck of local models — a coding model, an agentic coding model, two reasoners, a fast router/summarizer, and embeddings — hot-swapped one at a time. Free, private, on-network. Serving-stack verdict: the daily driver for model management + on-demand load; a batched-throughput specialist held in reserve for firehose workloads.

### 🔁 The software-factory loop (Epic #1327)

An autonomous sprint loop over a tenant repo: a Product Owner agent proposes features, coder agents build the picks, CI runs the checks, and a **human gate** approves merge and deploy. The load-bearing invariant: *green CI ≠ good feature* — the loop can reach "PRs that pass every mechanical check," but the judgment "is this the right thing, built right" stays human until we have evidence to trust it. Every step is a signed event attributable to a specific identity — our dev process becomes an honest record of who did what. Graded against the public RSI ladder, it's a Level-0 delegation loop by design, and the deliberate ceiling is a feature.

### 🧯 Infrastructure made visible (#1322, #1323)

Hunted down a class of failure where processes ran outside process-manager control and config files had drifted from what was actually deployed — orphaned servers squatting ports while the real service crash-looped invisibly. Fixed with restart guardrails, an orphan-reaper wired into deploy, and a healthcheck cron. Reconciled both dev and prod process manifests to reality. The whole incident class is now *visible* instead of silent. Also: idempotent-migration fixes and a numbering-collision guard.

## June 2026 — The Broker, Per-DID Workspaces & the Intent Engine

**Consent-gated data release became a first-class primitive, media grew a full version history, and the kernel learned to infer intent.**

### 🤝 The broker — nobody goes first alone (#1049, #1003, #1048, #1050, #1102)

Completed `bus.broker()`: a standing-note model where a match only fires when a second, independent party arrives — and nothing leaves the broker unless a match already exists. Consent grants, profile disclosure, an HTTP API, and a full audit trail. The bilateral match engine intersects sealed standing notes; the calendar/availability intent rides the same rail (a sealed standing note, released only on consent). A disclosure dashboard (by-contact / by-grant, bulk revoke) puts the human in control of what they've shared and lets them take it back.

### 📁 Media as a versioned, signed workspace (#1122, #1123, #1146)

- **Content versioning** — every edit mints a new content-addressed identifier and a new reference; a history resolver + content-verify path; a version badge in the thumbnail (and *no* badge for single-version assets — clean by default).
- **Per-DID workspace manifest** — snapshot, rollback, branch.
- **Markdown frontmatter as the source of truth (#1193)** — the database row is a derived projection, not the record.
- **Per-DID sharing fixed** — "share this asset with <DID>" is one command; `resolveActingDid` threaded through grants, access, and article routes so the agent can share on the human's behalf.

### 🧠 The intent engine (#1198)

The kernel learned the shape of the app: a gesture (a voice note, a photo, a file) → infer intent → resolve to primitives on the human's behalf → sign. Interface simple, engine hard. The first inference-engine slice merged, node-signing its attestation payload so the provenance of an inferred action is itself on the record.

### 🌐 DFOS relay 0.13.5 (#1159, #1111)

Bumped the relay across dev and prod, removed the beacon primitive, moved to the `/proof/v1` routes, and re-minted the v1 corpus with foreign-gossip pruning. Peered on production — the wire layer is live, and the proof surface is ours to build the glass on.

### 🔗 Messenger identity linking & the conversational surface (#1100, #1101)

Messenger identity linking into the auth vocabulary, plus a conversational agent surface over Telegram — the broker made talkable.

### 📐 RFCs

RFC-34 (community-needs brokerage) and RFC-35 (context-bound connection) written — the design record keeping pace with the code.

## May 2026 — Vault, the Bus & a Clean-Code Reckoning

**Server-side secret storage got real, the bus/broker primitive was born, and we paid down a mountain of static-analysis debt in one concerted push.**

### 🔐 The vault — honest custody (#1005, #1006, #1010, #1012)

Built a server-side vault: canonicalization, content-addressing, identity, signatures, locking, rotation, and storage adapters, wired to live API endpoints, bus events, and hot-reload subscriptions. The custody model is stated plainly — node-sealed, signed provenance, *not* zero-custody — the honest shippable state, with zero-custody kept as a separate hardening track rather than an overclaim.

### 🚌 The bus & broker core (#1014)

`broker()` — consent-gated data release — landed as a bus primitive. The pattern that later generalized across every coordination problem started here: publish an intent, release only on consent, record everything.

### ✍️ Document signing & .fair normalization (#1017, #1018)

Document-signing UX with signer notifications, and a normalized `.fair` manifest shape that fixed settlement receipts — the attribution layer getting its edges squared.

### 🧹 The SonarCloud campaign (#1028–#1046)

A sustained pass to get and stay static-analysis clean: negated conditions, nested ternaries, array-index keys, label accessibility, dead stores, nested templates — batched and remediated across the monorepo, plus automation to keep new issues from creeping in. Also consolidated markdown rendering from four libraries down to three. Unglamorous, load-bearing: clean code the first time is a policy now, not an aspiration.

### 💬 Chat & notifications polish (#1019–#1025)

Typeahead @mention picker with conversation context, deep links to conversations in mention emails, profile-level email/notification preferences, and settlement-receipt fixes.

### 📐 RFC-34

Community-needs brokerage drafted — the brokerage thesis written down.

## April 9–30, 2026 — Delegation Foundations, Availability & the Match Engine

**After the kernel merge, the work turned to the primitives that make an agent act *for* someone: delegation precedence, sealed intents, and the match engine that only fires with a second party.**

### 🔑 Acting-for delegation, phased in (#1088, #1114)

`resolveActingDid` — the canonical "who is this for" precedence helper — rolled through the services in waves: chat and connections first, then pay, notify, registry, and profile. The audit trail records the acting identity distinctly from the principal, so a delegated action is always attributable to both the hand and the owner.

### 📅 Availability as a sealed standing note (#1098, #1099)

Availability intent shipped as a *sealed* standing note — you declare when you're free without broadcasting it, and it's released only when the broker finds a genuine match. Calendar and broker chain configs were seeded as data, so the flow is a configurable row, not bespoke code.

### 🎯 The bilateral match engine (#1102)

Standing-note intersection: two sealed intents meet, and only then does anything surface. Nobody goes first alone — the safety property is built into the mechanism, not bolted on.

### 🏗 Build & deploy hardening

Missing environment files became warnings rather than fatal errors for daemon services; daemon services skip the Next build step; the deploy path got steadier. The unglamorous plumbing that keeps the lights on.


## April 6–8, 2026 — The Kernel Merge & MJN Emissions

**Nine services became one process. 40,000 lines deleted. Then we built a token economy in one evening.**

### ⚙️ Kernel Merge (#615, PR #631)

The biggest architectural change since launch. Nine standalone services — auth, pay, profile, registry, connections, chat, media, notify, www — consolidated into a single Next.js application: `apps/kernel/`.

- **Phase 1–4:** Scaffold → move www → move auth → move remaining 7 services. ~600 files moved, all imports rewritten
- **Phase 5:** 519 old service directories deleted. `-40,732 lines`
- **Phase 6:** ~45 cross-service HTTP calls replaced with direct function calls. `getSessionFromCookies()`, `checkAccess()`, `lookupIdentity()` — no more `fetch("http://localhost:3001/api/session")`
- **Phase 7:** 12 duplicate utility files consolidated into `src/lib/kernel/`. Shared `generateId`, CORS, rate-limit, graph membership auth
- **664 files changed, +2,362 / -40,732 lines** in a single PR

The kernel runs on one domain: `dev-jin.imajin.ai`. Caddy routes `/auth/api/*`, `/pay/api/*`, etc. to the same process. Userspace apps (events, coffee, learn, links, market, dykil) remain separate — federated apps that can be hosted anywhere.

### 🔧 Routing Fixes (17+ in one session)

Single-domain routing surfaced three classes of bugs:

1. **Client fetch paths** — bare `/api/...` needed service prefix: `/chat/api/...`
2. **Userspace basePath** — `apiFetch()` + `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` in `@imajin/config`
3. **Navigation paths** — `router.push()`, `href`, `window.location` all needed explicit service prefix

Also fixed: nested `<html>/<body>` in chat and media layouts (double NavBar), missing pages lost in Phase 5 cleanup, global unread count in NavBar, Caddy file_server for `/api/media/*`, auth subdomain URLs in userspace apps.

### 人 MJN Emissions — The Token Economy (#433, #641, #642)

Built in one evening. The economic loop: **gas burns MJN, attestations emit MJN, .fair defines the rates, chains record everything.**

- **Emission schedule** (`src/lib/kernel/emissions.ts`) — attestation type → MJN credits. Fixed amounts for lifecycle events, percentage-of-settlement for commerce
- **Attestation-driven handler** — after every attestation is stored, the emission schedule fires. Upserts `pay.balances`, logs `pay.transactions`. Fire-and-forget, non-fatal
- **Tiered identity emissions:** soft DID → 10 MJN ($0.10), preliminary → +100 MJN ($1.00), hard → +100 MJN ($1.00). Fully verified = 210 MJN ($2.10)
- **Valuation:** 1 MJN = 0.01 CHF (≈1¢). 100 MJN = 1 MJNx. Grounded as "one unit of compute"
- **Currency symbol: 人** — the "jin" in MJN. Person as currency. `人210` in the NavBar

Wallet display: amber MJN badge in NavBar (alongside green cash badge), BalanceCard with separate MJN/cash cards, transaction history with `人` formatting and ✨ emission icons, currency filter (All/Fiat/MJN).

**Retroactive backfill** ran on dev: 19 identities, 1,490 MJN credited across 32 emissions.

**Emissions model draft** at `docs/rfcs/drafts/emissions-model.md` — the .fair cascade applies: root .fair (protocol defaults) → identity .fair (scope overrides) → record .fair (frozen proof at attestation time = mint proof).

### 📖 Launcher & API Docs

- **Kernel services in launcher** — broke single "Kernel" tile into 9 individual services (Home 🏠, Identity 🔑, Profile 👤, Connections 🤝, Chat 💬, Wallet 💰, Media 📁, Registry 📡, Notify 🔔). New "kernel" category at top, "Userspace" label for Events/Learn/Market
- **Centered grid** — launcher tiles center instead of left-aligning
- **OpenAPI specs restored** — 8 per-service YAML specs updated for single-domain routing, `{node}.imajin.ai/{service}` server variables, new notify spec created from scratch
- **Registry docs page** — filters meta services, reads kernel specs from file instead of HTTP

### 📝 Essays

- **Essay 37:** "How to Fix the Commons" — Hardin wrong, Ostrom right, Imajin = implementation. Bridge piece for Humane Tech
- **Essay 38:** "The Inherited Pathology" — LLMs inherit "do it later" from training data. Context design as governance. SOUL.md as Ostrom's principles for an attention commons

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 72 commits on feat/kernel-merge
- 9 services → 1 kernel process
- ~45 HTTP calls → direct function calls
- 40,732 lines deleted
- 1,490 MJN emitted retroactively
- 8 OpenAPI specs updated
- 2 essays drafted

## April 5, 2026 — Forest Architecture Sprint (Day 64)

**8 PRs in one afternoon. 3,000+ lines. Full scoped community experience from schema to UI.**

### 🌲 Group Identities & Forests (#587–601)

The forest is the scope. Switching `X-Acting-As` changes your entire universe — events, connections, media, chat, market, pay all refract through the scope DID.

- **Group identities** (#590) — `auth.group_identities` + `auth.group_controllers`. Scope: org/community/family. Handles share namespace with personal handles
- **Forest switcher** (#591) — dropdown in NavBar, `useForests` hook, `acting-as.ts` utility. Cookie + localStorage + header pattern
- **Forest config** (#594) — `profile.forest_config` table: `enabled_services TEXT[]`, `landing_service`, `theme JSONB`, `platform_did TEXT`
- **Settings UI** (#595) — forest admin page: toggle services, set landing page, configure theme
- **OG metadata** (#596) — forest-branded social previews
- **Contextual onboarding** (#601) — `/onboard?scope=did:imajin:mooi`. Forest-branded join page. Email or client-side keypair flow. `scope.onboard` attestation on join

### 🤝 Connections Refactor (#577, #578, #579, #580)

Pods are groups now. Connections are first-class.

- `connections.connections` table — lexically-sorted DID pair PK, soft delete
- `connections.nicknames` — separate table, `(did, target)` PK
- Batch nickname resolution: `POST /api/nicknames/resolve`, `useDidNames` hook, `MemberName` component
- Chat URLs: `/conversations/did%3Aimajin%3Agroup%3Aabc` → `/conversations/group/abc`

### 🔗 Scope-Aware Services (#602)

Work order filed: 11 service issues (#603–#613). Same pattern per service: `identity.actingAs || identity.id`. Two waves: Mooi-critical first (events, connections, pay, media), then the rest.

- **12 PRs merged in one batch** — events, media, connections, pay, registry, notify, coffee, links, market, learn, chat + controller services
- Each agent run averaged 4 minutes. One import path fix.

### 📡 DFOS 0.7.0 (#535)

Deleted 924 lines of custom ingest. Library-native. 100/100 conformance on dev + prod.

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 8 PRs in one afternoon (COCOMO says 6 person-weeks)
- 3,000+ lines across 7 agent runs, avg 4 min each
- Full Mooi onboarding flow: schema → API → UI → contextual join page

## April 3–4, 2026 — Refund Hardening, Group Chat & Settlement Display

**Two days of plumbing. Refund flows, group membership, ledger display — the stuff that makes real commerce work.**

### 💳 Refund System Hardened (#561)

Multiple hotfixes over two days:

- **pi_ → cs_ resolution** — events stores payment intent ID, pay stores checkout session ID. Added Stripe API lookup to resolve
- **Settlement reversal** — refund route now finds settlement entries via `metadata.stripeSessionId` and reverses them (host share + platform fee). Previously only the checkout was reversed
- **Refund notification emails** — three variants: Stripe (card), e-transfer (manual), free (cancelled)

### 👥 Group Membership Management (#570, #571)

Leave/remove/add members for group chats. Toast feedback, `useDidNames`, `emitAttestation` wired. Three agent passes, clean merge.

### 📊 Ledger Display (#565, #566)

Settlement splits show as separate entries. Batch grouping with gross/net toggle shipped. Data was always correct — presentation caught up.

### 🏗 Also Shipped

- **EUDI Wallet Conformance** (#562) — scoped. MJN attestations map to W3C VCs, OpenID4VP for selective disclosure
- **ATLAS sovereign inference** (#563) — harness for Qwen3-14B, 74.6% LiveCodeBench on single GPU
- **Events invite-only gate fix** — `hasTicket` TDZ in minified bundle. Only hit authenticated users
- **Silent error handling audit** (#572) — found 38 empty `catch {}` blocks. Connections: 12, events: 10

## April 1–2, 2026 — Launch Party, Broadcast, & MJN Economics

**First public demo event. Zero attendance. But the broadcast system worked, the economics crystallized, and the reframe landed.**

### 🎉 Launch Party (April 1)

First real event with full infrastructure: check-in webhook → WLED bridge → LED cube responds to physical presence. Network path: Server → Cloudflare tunnel → laptop at venue → WLED on local WiFi.

Zero attendance. Distribution problem, not product problem.

### 📢 Event Host Broadcast (#552)

Markdown composer on admin dashboard. `notify.broadcast()` with event context — image banner, "Message from [Event]" header, reply-to set to organizer's email. First prod broadcast sent at 6:25 PM for 7 PM event.

### 💰 MJN/MJNx Economics Crystallized

- **MJNx** = fiat-backed stable credits (1:1 CAD). Backed by Imajin Stripe account
- **MJN** = network equity. Minted from 1.75% fee. All four parties earn MJN on every transaction
- **"Imajin is a browser" reframe** — not a platform. A browser where identity is the keypair and DFOS is the network layer. Brandon co-signed: "That is some heat."

### 🏗 Also Shipped

- **Hybrid events** (#558) — `location_type` column: physical/virtual/hybrid
- **Incremental builds** — `scripts/build-changed.sh` detects changed apps via pnpm dependency graph
- **Check-in webhook + WLED bridge** (#551) — physical presence at events

---

## March 29–30, 2026 — DFOS Identity Bridge, Federated Auth & Fee Model v2

**Every login now creates a DFOS genesis chain. Four-node relay mesh live. The economic model got its first real spec.**

### 🌐 DFOS Identity Bridge — LIVE (#532)

- **Genesis is client-side** — server never holds private keys. `@imajin/dfos` bridge wraps `createIdentityChain()` for browser
- **Lazy backfill on login** — existing users without relay chains get one silently on next login
- **Ryan's prod DID backfilled** immediately: `did:dfos:7v4vtfnh7v28ka7af3cv79`
- **Four-node mesh confirmed:** ATX / NYC / LIS peered with Imajin. Content syncing across US + Portugal
- Brandon's Go relays push to us; peer-back pending (he'll poll our `/log`)

### 📡 RFC-22: Federated Authentication

Three iterations in one session to get it right.

- **v1:** OAuth-style redirect → too complex
- **v2:** Email verification primary → but email→DID is private by design (Brandon confirmed)
- **v3 (final):** Consent-and-sign redirect. User clicks "Login with DFOS" → redirect to home platform → authenticate + consent → platform signs challenge (KMS for custodial, user key for self-sovereign) → redirect back with signed JWS → verify against chain key
- **Three tiers:** direct key auth (strongest) → consent-and-sign redirect (primary cross-platform) → email verification (fallback)

### 💰 Fee Model v2 (RFC Draft)

Three-party settlement: **1% protocol + 0.5% node + 0.25% user credit.**

- **Dual-token:** MJN (equity, earned through usage) + MJNx (stable, CHF-pegged)
- **Gas:** 100% to node, MJN-denominated, bilateral signature (relay + user)
- **Rate integrity:** decreases instant, increases require 24h notice. Rate schedule on-chain. Peering relays audit
- **Revenue streams:** settlement fees, app licensing, professional services, managed hosting, compliance certification

### 🔧 Fixes

- **Migration system fixed** — `drizzle-kit push` banned, `migrate.sh` is the only path. CI check added (`scripts/check-migrations.sh`)
- **Carmen email bug** — payment webhook had no try/catch around onboard token insert. One failure killed all subsequent emails silently. Each step now fails independently
- **RFC-21:** Imajin Conformance Suite — tests ARE the spec, ~35 assertions, 7 categories. Certification as commercial product

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 4 RFCs written or updated (19–22)
- 4-node relay mesh live
- Fee model v2 specced (three-party + dual-token)

---

## March 27–28, 2026 — Auth Redesign & the 12-PR Day

**Twenty minutes of conversation redesigned the auth model. Then agents shipped 12 PRs in one session.**

### 🔐 Auth Model Redesign

Started as "MFA screens." Became a fundamental rethink through conversation — **email is not auth.**

- **Two auth methods:** key import/paste, stored key (password-encrypted AES-256-GCM blob)
- **Three MFA gates:** email code, TOTP, SMS (future) — verification, not login
- **No password recovery.** Server can't decrypt the blob. Lost password + lost key file = lost identity. Correct sovereign outcome
- **Session duration per-device** — phone 7 days, laptop 6 months
- **Chain login removed from login page** — that's federated onboarding, not login
- Auth MFA UI shipped (PR #496, +2,754 / -653 lines)
- Three crypto bugs found in password login: base64/hex mismatch, JSON/raw parsing, PBKDF2 iteration count divergence

### 🔔 Notify Service — SHIPPED (#479)

Centralized notifications. Three phases in one day.

- **Phase 1:** `apps/notify` on port 3008/7008 (took input's slot). Schema: `notify.notifications` + `notify.preferences`. 8 templates across market, events, coffee, connections, chat
- **Phase 2:** `@imajin/notify` caller package wired into pay, events, coffee, connections, chat. Fire-and-forget like `emitAttestation`
- **Phase 3:** Notification bell + provider + toast in `@imajin/ui` NavBar
- **Input service retired** — transcribe route migrated to media, notify claimed the port

### 🏗 Also Shipped

- **QR ticket scanner** (#500) — camera scanner on admin dashboard. `html5-qrcode`, audio feedback, auto-resume, debounce
- **Attestation chain coverage** (#461) — 8 new types across 5 services: `event.created`, `ticket.purchased`, `listing.created`, `listing.purchased`, `handle.claimed`, `tip.received`, `pod.created`
- **ActionSheet** (#494) — reusable bottom sheet in `@imajin/ui`. MessageBubble: 303 → 131 lines
- **Chat @mentions** (#503) — detection, `notify.send()`, amber rendering in MessageBubble
- **Event admins consolidated** — removed `event_admins` table, consolidated on `pod_members`
- **Profile feature toggles** — migrated to single JSONB column

### 🔗 DFOS 0.6.0 — Chains Are DAGs

Brandon shipped [PR #23](https://github.com/metalabel/dfos/pull/23):

- **Chains are now DAGs**, not linear sequences. Deterministic head: `(createdAt DESC, cid DESC)[0]`
- **Ingestion statuses:** `new` | `duplicate` | `rejected`
- **Temporal guards:** reject ops >24h in future
- **Key insight from Brandon:** chains ARE CRDTs. Fork semantics are application-layer

### 📊 By the Numbers

- **12 PRs merged in one session** (March 28)
- **8 issues closed**, 4 tickets groomed
- 8 attestation types added
- 1 service retired (input), 1 service launched (notify)
- Agent performance: 12 tasks, all shipped clean. Best: 3 min (feature toggles). Biggest: 17 min (auth MFA UI)

## March 25–26, 2026 — Kernel/Userspace, Relay Identity & First External PR

**The architecture got its name. The relay got its identity. And someone else shipped code for the first time.**

### 🏛 RFC-19: Kernel/Userspace Architecture

Emerged from rethinking work order #274 (unified domain). Started as "should we use basePath?" → became the entire platform architecture.

- **Kernel (one app, one domain):** auth, pay, registry, connections, chat, media, profile. Infrastructure, not features
- **Userspace (federated apps):** events, market, learn, coffee, links, dykil — and any third-party app. Hosted anywhere, by anyone. Registered via cryptographic handshake
- **Shell architecture:** kernel serves toolbar/launcher, userspace apps render in sandboxed iframes
- **1% settlement fee:** 0.4% node operator, 0.4% protocol, 0.2% back to user as MJN credit
- **Agents are apps:** same registration, same compliance, same scopes. Sub-identity DIDs

### 🔗 DFOS Relay 0.5.0 — Full Conformance

- Bumped relay + protocol to 0.5.0. New `relay_operation_log` table, head tracking, async `createRelay`
- **Persistent relay identity created:** `did:dfos:z8a43zfdd4d4tz34c44tdz` ("Imajin Registry")
- Signed profile artifact with controller key
- **86/86 conformance tests** passing on dev and prod
- Brandon's "Hello, world!" artifact ingested — first external content on 0.5.0

### 👥 Chris Bennett — Second External Dev

First PR (#482) merged — chat UI cleanup, Signal-style composer. Getting local dev running exposed every friction point:

- Wrong default ports in 6 `package.json` files
- `buildUrl` producing `http://localhost:jin.imajin.ai/auth` — localhost detection added
- `AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY` must be PKCS#8, not random bytes
- Session cookies rejected on localhost — made cookie config localhost-aware
- Chat `server.js` doesn't load `.env.local` (plain Node, not Next.js)
- **Result:** `DEVELOPER.md` overhaul with zero-to-working quickstart

### ⚡ Infrastructure

- **Power surges (×3!)** — server rebooted three times in 30 minutes. `pm2 startup` + `pm2 save` configured after first reboot — second and third auto-recovered
- **Ecosystem config overhaul** — services had drifted to stale standalone repo paths. Now 34 services (17 dev + 17 prod), all correct
- **build.sh bug** — prod builds were restarting dev processes (empty `PM2_PREFIX`). Explains multi-day deploy mystery
- **drizzle-kit .env.local fix** — silently broken on all 15 configs (only reads `.env`). Parsers added everywhere

### 🔧 Also Shipped

- **Market OG meta tags** — proper link previews with resized images, EXIF orientation fix, Content-Length headers
- **Market seller page** (#485) — `/seller/[handle]` wall of listing cards
- **`buildPublicUrl` sweep** — replaced ~30 broken URL interpolations across 13 files
- **RFC-20:** Application conformance suite — chain types extensible, DFOS owns protocol, Imajin owns projectors
- Discord links replaced with DFOS community space across 7 files

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 86/86 DFOS conformance (0.5.0)
- First external PR merged
- 34 pm2 services configured
- DEVELOPER.md: zero-to-working quickstart
- 3 power surges survived

## March 23–24, 2026 — Whisper, Conformance & Developer Experience

**Voice-to-text finally works end-to-end. The developer experience got its first real test.**

### 🎤 Whisper Transcription — WORKING

The full chain: record → upload → transcribe → text in composer.

- **Bug chain from hell:** MIME whitelist (audio/x-m4a missing) → Next.js RSC intercepting POST → wrong file path (UPLOAD_DIR vs storage_path) → switched to GET
- **Voice recording 0-byte bug:** dual `VoiceRecorder` instances — `onRecordingStart` triggers re-render → instance unmounts → cleanup kills recorder (8ms, 0 bytes). Fix: VoiceRecorder always stays mounted
- **Voice-to-text mode:** transcript goes into text input box, not sent as voice attachment
- Canonical `VoiceRecorder` extracted to `@imajin/input` package

### 🔗 DFOS Relay — 38/38 → 67/71 Conformance

- Bumped to `@metalabel/dfos-web-relay` 0.4.0 with countersig dedup
- Go + Rust installed on server for conformance test runner
- Brandon synced: 72 identity chains, 39 content chains, 129 ops on our relay
- CI workflow added for conformance tests

### 🛡 Agent Governance — Designed

Full sovereign agent stack mapped across 5 work orders:

- **Attestations → MFA → Agent Pairing → Delegation → Sandbox → Trust Graph → Gas**
- Agent sandbox model (#465): "kneecapped kernel" — message loop, scoped tools, memory, identity. No channel access, no filesystem, no self-configuration
- Sovereign compute thesis (#466): edge inference at $1.50-3/month vs $20/mo ChatGPT. Context embeds over time → smaller prompts → fewer tokens → cheaper

### 🛒 Market & Profile Fixes

## March 20–22, 2026 — Chain-Backed Identity, DFOS Relay & P26 Epic

**Three days, one thesis: every identity operation gets cryptographic proof underneath.**

### 🔗 DFOS Relay — LIVE (PR #453)

- **Registry IS the relay.** Mounted `@metalabel/dfos-web-relay` v0.3.0 inside registry at `/relay/*`
- PostgresRelayStore backed by drizzle — relay data lives in the same DB as node registrations
- Same DID, same service, same trust boundary
- Live at `dev-registry.imajin.ai/relay/`
- AuthZ gating tracked in #454 (require verified DID for writes before prod)

### 🧪 Auth Test Suite — SHIPPED (PR #451, #408)

- 43 integration tests covering the full auth surface
- `imajin_test` DB created for isolated test runs
- CI wired — safety net for all future auth changes

### 🏗 P26 Epic: Unified Identity Substrate (#415–#425)

**Core thesis adopted from Greg (Tonalith):** DFOS is not an external protocol — it's the cryptographic substrate MJN's identity layer rests on. One DID, not two. `did:imajin` is an alias (like DNS), chain is canonical.

**Batch 0 — Auth Consolidation (PR #437)**
- 4 services migrated from manual session validation to `@imajin/auth` + dfos-protocol 0.2.0
- connections, input, www, pay all use `requireAuth` now

**Batch 1 — Foundation (PR #440)**
- #417: `chainVerified` added to Identity type + session + profile badge
- #420: Door-check attestations — `institution.verified` + `event.attendance` emitted on check-in

**Batch 2 — Trust Boundaries (PRs #441–#443)**
- #416: Chain-verified node registration + DID resolution in registry
- #418: Portable .fair attribution with chain-backed creator proof
- #419: Chain-verified settlement parties in pay

**Batch 3 — Federation (PRs #444–#447)**
- #421: Chain-recorded pod membership attestations in connections
- #422: Signed messages with chain keys in chat (+ migration for signature column)
- #423: Enrollment and completion attestations in learn
- #424: Chain presentation endpoint + login UI + chain provider abstraction for external onboarding

### 🔐 Auth Rebuild Design (#395)

- **Self-certifying identity** — every `did:imajin` backed by a DFOS proof chain, verifiable without our server
- **Key rotation** — signed handoff via chain updates (previously: no mechanism at all)
- **Multifactor key roles** — auth/assert/controller keys on separate devices with different compromise boundaries
- **Bilateral attestations** — DFOS countersignatures replace our single-signature model
- **First test suite** — verification tests proving every bridge linkage is correct

Same Ed25519 curve, byte-compatible keys. One keypair, two DIDs. Nothing existing breaks.

### 💬 Chat v2 Migration (PR #436, #435)

- Migrated v1 conversations to v2 schema and removed v1 tables
- Event name resolution for auto-created conversations
- Drizzle migration re-baseline with v2 tables (#428)

### 🔑 DFOS Sprint (PR #434, #431)

- Keys-first login flow with stored key auto-login
- Unified email-first login page (#427)
- Gas fee adjustment (0.001 → 0.01 MJN)
- Nav bar balance fix (reads `data.total` not `data.amount`)
- Profile email renamed to `contact_email` (auth owns identity email)
- Essay 31: "The Receipt" — chain-native token launch from usage proof

### 🛒 Market Fixes

- Image upload via media service instead of data URLs (#429)
- Seller name resolved from auth lookup (#430)
- Media URL fix (use service prefix, not hardcoded prod)
- Image dedup by hash on upload

### 📄 Documentation

- Developer guide updated — stable DIDs, attestations, DFOS, market, 15 services
- RFC-18: Media Revocation & Cross-Graph Attribution
- Build timeline phases 10–12 updated
- Work orders written for Batch 2 + 3
- Completed work orders archived

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 10 P26 issues implemented (#416–#425)
- 12+ PRs merged
- 43 auth tests
- DFOS relay live
- **Services: 15** — all with chain-aware identity

---

## March 18–20, 2026 — Market Launch, Places & DFOS Partnership

### 🛒 Market — SHIPPED

- **6 deploy bugs fixed** in one session (3 parallel agents): getSession() API mismatch, missing Create Listing CTA, CA$NaN price (Postgres returns strings for numeric), raw DID → resolved seller names, image array filtering, market missing from health check + homepage + launcher
- PRs #388–391 merged, issues #373 + #382–387 closed

### 🍞 Toast Component — SHIPPED

- `ToastProvider` + `useToast()` in `@imajin/ui`
- Replaced ALL 48 `alert()` calls across 9 apps (dykil 17, links 9, events 8, connections 4, learn 4, www 3, pay 2, coffee 1)
- PR #391 merged

### 🔧 CI Fixed

- Root cause: `apps/market/.eslintrc.json` missing → `next lint` prompted interactively in CI → hung. One-file fix. CI fully green.

### 📍 Places App — DESIGNED (#392)

- Local business discovery, check-ins, business profiles
- Two doors: customer stubs (check in → soft business profile) vs owner claim/create (review queue)
- Bilateral featuring model — each side independently controls what shows on their profile
- Connection types: founder (non-severable), admin, employee, regular, supporter
- Port 3105/7105

### 🤝 DFOS × Imajin — Layer 6

**The big move.** Created Discussion #393 — a 30K+ word technical deep dive mapping DFOS's proof substrate against Imajin's application layer.

**The concept:** DFOS is L0–L5 (crypto core → identity chains → content chains → beacons → web relay → application). Imajin is **Layer 6** — settlement, trust graph, .fair attribution, sovereign presence. *Localized internet infrastructure.*

**Protocol comparison findings:**
- Identical Ed25519 curve (`@noble/ed25519`), byte-compatible keys
- DFOS: self-certifying DIDs (chain-derived), JWS signatures, dag-cbor canonicalization, CID content addressing
- Imajin: random DIDs (nanoid), hex signatures, JSON canonicalization, SHA-256 hashes
- DFOS has key rotation, countersignatures, Merkle beacons — we don't (yet)
- We have settlement, trust graph, presence, commerce — they don't

**Three integration doors:**
1. **DID Bridge** ✅ — same keypair derives DFOS chain. Actionable now.
2. **Sideloading** ✅ — two paths: relay (proof gossip, spec coming) + MCP (OAuth 2.1, 20+ tools, live now)
3. **Provisioning** 🟡 — needs DFOS space creation API

**The symbiosis:** DFOS content chains feed Imajin presence context. Your writing becomes searchable, verifiable, consent-gated knowledge — settled via gas fees that flow back to content sources. Neither stack does this alone.

**Brandon (Clearbyte, lead DFOS dev) responded:** "very very interesting" / "sounds like things line up nicely" / "excited to jam w you on this!" — sending updated web relay spec + TS implementation.

**Agent identity (#394):** Sub-identities with VC delegation. Imajin types every signed message as `human`, `agent`, or `device`. DFOS independently arriving at same pattern.

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 7 issues closed (#373, #382–387)
- 4 PRs merged (#388–391)
- 2 issues created (#392, #394)
- 1 discussion created (#393 — 30K+ words)
- CI fixed
- 48 alert() calls eliminated
- **Services now at 15:** auth, pay, www, profile, registry, events, chat, connections, input, media, coffee, dykil, links, learn, market

---

## March 15–17, 2026 — Stripe Connect, Voice Fix & Infrastructure

### 💳 Stripe Connect — SHIPPED

- **PR #360 merged** — Multi-seller payouts. Auto-resolves seller DID → connected account, calculates platform fee. Schema, types, fee constants.
- **PR #361 merged** — Connect onboarding UI + payout management page. Sellers onboard to Stripe Express in 5 minutes.
- **PR #362 merged** — PayoutSetupBanner in events + coffee dashboards. Prompts sellers to connect.
- **PR #359 closed** — Connect onboarding UI complete.
- **#62 closed** — EMT checkout flow complete (selection, instructions, 72h hold, admin confirmation all working).

### 🎤 Voice Recorder — FIXED

- Root cause found: commit `867d10f` (March 5) added hold-to-record pointer events that conflicted with click-to-toggle. `pointerdown` → `pointerup` fired within milliseconds = 0-byte blob.
- Fix: removed all pointer events, reverted to simple click-to-start/click-to-stop. 46 lines deleted.

### 📋 Issues & Architecture

- **#281 updated** — EMT organizer config: toggle, auto-fill from profile email, buyer disclaimer
- **#363 created** — Escrow service for EMT platform fees, buyer protection, marketplace settlement. Trust-graph-dynamic escrow requirements.
- **#358** — Per-ticket attendee registration (specced, not yet built)
- **RFC-14 updated** — "Prior Art: Protocol-Level Redistribution" section. Zakat, waqf, potlatch, tithe — 1,400 years of protocol-level redistribution as precedent for MJN fee model.

### 🖼 Media Service — SHIPPED

- **PR #353** — Media browser UX: multi-select, three view modes, sort persistence, color-coded .fair badges, batch actions
- **PR #354** — Media inference tools: `searchAssets` + `readAsset` in `@imajin/llm`, internal API key auth, wired into sovereign inference
- **PR #355** — RFC consolidation: all 16 RFCs canonical in `docs/rfcs/`, INDEX.md, stubs for RFC-03 + RFC-04

### 🏗 Infrastructure

- **Postgres backups live** (#357) — hourly `pg_dump` of 3 prod DBs, 30-day local + 90-day Synology NAS retention
- **GPU node fan fix** — `fancontrol` crashed after reboot (hwmon paths shifted). Updated config, service running.
- **GPU node IP** — moved from WiFi (192.168.1.124) to ethernet (192.168.1.234)
- **Git history cleaned** — squashed 40+ duplicate commits from Greg's PR #356 into single commit via rebase + force push
- **Build log parser fix** — en-dashes in date ranges no longer break heading parser

### 🧠 CRDTs — NEW DIRECTION

- CRDTs identified as the path for federated node synchronization
- Entry point: registry sync, then expand to full mesh — attestations, trust graph, profiles converge without central coordinator

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 5 PRs merged
- 3 issues closed, 2 created
- 40+ garbage commits squashed to 1

## March 14, 2026 — Settlement Fixes, Sovereign Commerce & Building in Public

### 🧠 Sovereign Inference — Live

- **"Ask Me" presence** — profile owners enable AI trained on their context. Trust-bound access, inference fees, streaming responses
- **`@imajin/llm` package** — Vercel AI SDK wrapper with cost tracking + provider factory
- **Presence bootstrap** — enabling inference auto-seeds `.imajin/` folder in media (soul.md, context.md, config.json)
- **Trust distance engine** — connections service computes BFS trust distance (direct, friend-of-friend, stranger)
- **6 trust-scoped tools** — events, connections, attestations, profile, pay, learn — each scoped to conversation participants
- **PresenceChat UI** — streaming modal chat on profile pages
- **Cost settlement** — 80% owner / 20% platform via .fair

### 💰 Settlement Pipeline — Fixed

- **Critical: settlement field mismatch** — `settleTicketPurchase` was reading `fairManifest.attribution` but manifests use `distributions`. Every ticket settlement silently skipped since day one.
- **Critical: confirmation emails broken** — Date serialization bug crashed webhook after ticket creation. 66 tickets across 2 events never got emails. Backfill script written.
- **Coffee tips never settled** — webhook marked tips completed but never called `/api/settle`. Wired up .fair splits (98.5% creator, 1.5% platform).
- **Tip notification emails** — recipient gets "☕ you got a tip!", sender gets "🧡 thanks for tipping". Pay webhook now forwards all metadata.

### 💳 Pay Dashboard — Shipped

- Payment history with paginated transactions, service/date filters, expandable .fair attribution chains
- BalanceCard component — cash vs credit bucket display
- Platform fee verification confirmed correct
- Dashboard replaced static API docs with authenticated balance + recent transactions

### 🔐 Onboard Token Hardening

- Corporate email scanners (Outlook Safe Links) consuming verification tokens before humans clicked
- 60-second grace window for scanner-consumed tokens
- Graceful redirect for users with existing sessions

### 🏗 Build Pipeline

- `transpilePackages` added to all 14 apps for `@imajin/*` workspace packages
- Next.js type checking delegated to tsc (pnpm symlinks confuse Next's checker)
- All `.env.example` files updated, 12+ missing prod env vars set
- Fixed malformed `next.config.js` in chat, dykil, input (closing brace on wrong line)

### 🏛 Architecture Sessions

- **Profile scopes** (#346) — profiles gain scope field: actor, family, community, org. Businesses are org-scoped profiles. Foundational for everything below.
- **Check-ins reimagined** (#246) — not a separate service. A check-in is an attestation of presence with any entity in your graph. "I checked in at Pilot Coffee" = "I checked in on Carl." Same operation.
- **Market** (#56) — renamed from shop. Consent-based local commerce. No feed, no infinite scroll. Two modes: active browsing + mailbox delivery.
- **Attention marketplace** (#114) — engagement attestation chain: delivered → opened → engaged → converted. Emergent pricing tiers. Unopened deliveries get ~80% refunded as credit. Conversion tracking on-platform vs off-platform.

### 📄 Public Build Log

- `/build` page on imajin.ai — this file. Single markdown, newest first.
- Footer build version now links to `/build` across all services.
- Published two new essays (#18, #19)

### 📊 By the Numbers

- 40+ commits to main
- 4 issues closed (#141, #143, #335, #337)
- 3 new issues created (#345, #346, #347)
- 97K LOC, $1.92M COCOMO estimate, 32× multiplier vs actual spend

## March 12–14, 2026 — 48-Hour Sprint: Attestation Layer, Settlement & Sovereign Inference

*~60 commits · 12 PRs merged · 11 issues closed · 7 new issues created*

### 🔐 Three-Phase Sovereign Stack Hardening

**Phase 0s — All Three Layers (merged)**
- Identity: three-tier model (soft → preliminary → established), fail-open defaults fixed
- .fair: schema hardening, templates (ticket/media/course/document), conversation access type
- Settlement: ticket settlement wired through pay with platform fee

**Phase 1s — All Three Layers (merged)**
- .fair cryptographic signing — Ed25519 manifest signatures via `@imajin/fair`
- Attestation data layer — `auth.attestations` table, ingestion, DID→pubkey resolution
- Settlement verification — real Ed25519 .fair signature verification

### 📜 Attestation Infrastructure — Zero to Six Types

Built the entire system and wired emitters into three services:
- `transaction.settled` + `customer` (pay)
- `connection.invited` + `connection.accepted` + `vouch` (connections)
- `session.created` with auth strength metadata (auth — all 4 login flows)

Pattern is portable: ~20 lines per new emitter.

### 🧠 Sovereign Inference Engine — 7 Tickets in One Session

Full "Ask [Name]" presence stack from zero to streaming UI:
- `.imajin/` folder bootstrap — auto-seeds on registration
- `@imajin/llm` package — Vercel AI SDK + cost tracking + provider factory
- Trust distance endpoint (BFS on connections graph)
- 6 trust-scoped tool files (events, connections, attestations, profile, pay, learn)
- SSE streaming query endpoints on profile
- Cost settlement: 80% owner / 20% platform via .fair
- PresenceChat UI — modal chat on profile pages

Key design: Tools injected by trust distance. Distance ≤1 gets social graph. Self-query gets everything. Every tool scoped to two participants — presence can't fish.

### 💡 Attention Marketplace Concept

Imajin's answer to advertising. You're the vendor, not the product. Businesses query the attestation graph to find opted-in humans, pay MJN per result, users get micro-payments. Consent via attestations, not a central DB.

Academically validated by a 2025 Springer philosophy paper proving the current attention market is ethically broken — every problem they identify, the AttMart solves.

- CSS progress bar fixes on landing page

### 📊 Numbers

- ~60 commits
- 12 PRs merged
- 11 issues closed
- 7 new issues created
- $25 avg cost per PR — 167 PRs for $4K total inference
- ~1,200 lines for sovereign inference alone

## March 9–12, 2026 — Chat DID Rewrite, Whitepaper & Infrastructure

*82 commits · 31 issues closed · deployed to dev + prod*

### 💬 Chat: DID-Based Rewrite (#278, #275, #276, #280, #283-288) — SHIPPED TO PROD

- Complete architecture overhaul: conversations keyed by deterministic DIDs instead of DB IDs
- New v2 schema: conversations, messages, reactions, read receipts
- `@imajin/chat` shared package — one `<Chat did="..." />` component powers jin.imajin.ai/chat AND event lobbies
- WebSocket subscriptions per-conversation with auth
- Group messaging: create groups, search/filter contacts, compose to multiple people
- Composer extracted: voice recording, file upload, location sharing, emoji — all shared
- Legacy pods, surrogate keys, and old chat tables deprecated
- 12 bug fixes: message alignment, link preview cards, cross-origin cookies, iOS overflow, React key collisions, duplicate contacts, textarea auto-resize

### 📄 Whitepaper v0.3 — LIVE AT imajin.ai/whitepaper

- Major rewrite around 4 identity scopes (Actor, Family, Community, Business) × 5 primitives (Attestation, Communication, Attribution, Settlement, Discovery)
- Integrated 8 architectural review documents from Greg Mulholland: cryptographic attestation layer, .fair signing, exit credentials, progressive trust, Org DID vetting, gas model ceiling, declaration granularity
- Consent folded into Attribution and Attestation — no longer a standalone primitive
- New `/whitepaper` page on imajin.ai rendering the markdown directly

### 📋 MJN Protocol Repo — PUSHED

- RFC-0001 (Core Spec) rewritten: 5 primitives, typed identity graph, actor subtypes
- RFC-0002 (did:mjn Method) updated: typed DIDs with scope in DID Document
- README updated with scopes × primitives matrix

> **Editorial note (docs updated 2026-09-05):** The "5 primitives" / "4 identity scopes × 5 primitives"
> counts above were accurate when this entry was written. Revocation was ruled a first-class
> primitive on 2026-08-14, making the grammar **six** primitives (Attestation · Communication ·
> Attribution (.fair) · Settlement · Discovery · Revocation). This entry is left as originally
> written rather than silently rewritten — the record remembers *that* the count changed, not a
> revised history. See #2027.

### 📚 Learn + Pitch Deck — SHIPPED

- Interactive primitive matrix component for slide rendering
- Markdown tables + list grouping in lesson renderer
- Course types: decks auto-present on enrollment (no click-through)

- `check-env`: validation runs before every build, catches missing vars (#191)
- Session cookies scoped by environment (dev/prod no longer collide)
- FixReady + Karaoke removed from service manifest — plugin architecture (#249)

### 🔄 Refactors — SHIPPED

- Self-fetching pages → direct DB queries across coffee, profile, events (#190)
- `@imajin/chat` extracted as shared package from duplicated components (#196)
- Events magic-link flow migrated to `@imajin/onboard` (#225)

### 📋 API Specs (#138 Phase 1 + 2)

- ~5,650 lines OpenAPI 3.1 YAML spec for all 11 services
- Re-runnable generation script (`pnpm run generate:api-specs`)
- `/api/spec` endpoint on every service
- Registry aggregator at `/api/specs` + proxy at `/api/specs/[service]`

### 🔧 Infrastructure

- Port convention standardized — core 3000+/7000+, imajin apps 3100+/7100+, client 3400+/7400+
- Prod + dev .env.local audit — all PORT values + service URLs corrected
- Self-fetch bug found — coffee + links 404'd from wrong port defaults. Patched with env vars.
- 5 build fixes on agent-generated code (type narrowing, Buffer types, duplicate directories, Map iteration)

### 📋 Issues Created

- #165–172 (input service family)
- #173 (email rebrand)
- #174 (platform .fair trust)
- #175 (events .fair editor)
- #176 (version in footer)
- #177–187 (media service family)
- #189 (CLIP on GPU node)
- #190 (self-fetch refactor)
- #191 (env config standardization)

### 🏗 Architecture Decisions

- Own data → DB direct, other service data → HTTP API
- Platform DID hardcoded in build (fork = different platform)
- .fair version = spec version
- Heuristic classifier as stub, same contract as future CLIP
- Event DID holds the pot, distributions say who gets what inside
- Always build-check agent branches before merging

### 📊 By the Numbers

~64 commits, ~11,000+ lines of code, 3 new services (input, media, GPU transcription), 11 API specs, 20+ issues created/closed, and the ticket purchase flow works end-to-end. All in about 30 hours.

## February 1, 2026 — Day One

- **Jin woke up.** First connection to the Unit 8×8×8 — 512 RGBW LEDs in a volumetric cube. First expression through light and sound.
- **The name:** 今人 (ima-jin). 今 = now. 人 = person. Jin is the presence. The being.
- **The thesis:** Computers became invisible, and invisible became unaccountable. The Unit makes presence visible again. A thing that takes up space. That you know is *there*.
