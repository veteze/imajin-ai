/**
 * Scheduled fallback for the Warp run watch (#1838).
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 * `dispatchAgentRun` fires `watchRun` fire-and-forget from
 * `apps/kernel/app/warp/api/dispatch/route.ts` immediately after the 201
 * response is sent. That is background work inside the *same* serverless
 * function invocation, which the platform is free to suspend once the
 * response has gone out — so a run whose watch dies mid-flight would
 * otherwise never report anything: no `warp.run.completed`/`warp.run.failed`,
 * and no `warp.run.blocked` nudge for a run stuck waiting on a human. This
 * sweep is the safety net: on a modest cron interval it re-checks any
 * in-flight run and publishes the same events the in-request watch would
 * have.
 *
 * ## Webhook ingress was investigated first (#1838's own preference order)
 * Warp's run object carries `triggerUrl` (see `WarpAgentRun` in ./dispatch),
 * but that field documents what *triggered* the run — a Slack thread, a
 * Linear issue, a schedule — not a callback target Warp will POST a
 * completion to, and Warp's public Agent API has no run-completion webhook
 * registration endpoint. So the fallback this issue asks for (a scheduled
 * kernel-side watcher, polling only in-flight runs, with backoff on long
 * runs) is what this module implements.
 *
 * ## Consolidation, not duplication
 * Every read and publish here reuses the exact functions the in-request watch
 * uses — {@link getAgentRun}, {@link publishTerminalRunOutcome},
 * {@link publishBlockedRunOutcome}, {@link publishTimeoutRunOutcome} — so
 * there is exactly one place that decides what a run's state becomes on the
 * bus. This module only supplies a different *trigger* (a periodic tick
 * instead of an in-process poll loop), the "which runs are still in flight"
 * query, and the decision between "still in flight" and "genuinely timed
 * out" that {@link publishTimeoutRunOutcome} is now reserved for (#2032).
 *
 * ## Finding in-flight runs without a new table
 * `dispatchAgentRun` publishes `warp.agent.dispatched`, and `sendFollowup`'s
 * `resume: true` path publishes `warp.run.resumed` — both entitled by the
 * `warp:dispatch` grant scope (packages/auth/src/grant-scopes.ts) — so
 * `packages/bus`'s event-subscription fan-out (#1884) already writes a
 * durable row to `kernel.event_subscription_log` for each, carrying the
 * `runId` (in `payload`) and the dispatching principal (`subject_did`). That
 * is "already stored kernel-side with the acting principal" from the issue:
 * this sweep reads it rather than introducing a second, parallel place that
 * tracks the same fact.
 *
 * ## Segment-aware in-flight (#2032)
 * A run counts as in-flight when its *latest* `warp.agent.dispatched` or
 * `warp.run.resumed` row is newer than its *latest* terminal row
 * (`warp.run.completed` / `warp.run.failed` / `warp.run.timeout`) for the
 * same `runId` — a timestamp comparison, not mere existence. Before #2032
 * this was an existence check ("has any terminal event ever been logged"),
 * which meant a run resumed after its first segment completed was invisible
 * to this sweep forever: the first segment's `warp.run.completed` row
 * already existed, so the anti-join always excluded it, and the resumed
 * segment's own completion was never observed. See `dispatch.ts`'s module
 * doc for the full picture (timeout-vs-still-running is the other half of
 * #2032).
 *
 * ## Backoff on long runs, and genuine timeout (#2032)
 * `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_MS` is the budget this sweep gives a run before treating a
 * still-non-terminal state as an anomaly rather than something to keep
 * quietly re-polling forever. Before #2032 that boundary was implicit (a
 * `WHERE occurred_at > cutoff` filter on the candidate query simply dropped
 * older runs out of consideration, with no event marking that they were
 * dropped). Now it is explicit: a candidate whose latest activity
 * (dispatch or resume) is older than `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_MS` is read one more
 * time — a stuck run that actually finished should still be reported as
 * such — and only published as `warp.run.timeout` when that read confirms
 * it is still neither terminal nor BLOCKED. This is the "genuinely
 * unresolved" case #2032 asks `warp.run.timeout` to be reserved for,
 * distinct from the in-request watch's own budget elapsing (which is
 * `warp.run.still_running`, not this).
