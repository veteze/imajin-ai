# The Warp notification chain: kernel half

This is the kernel-side counterpart to
[`openclaw-imajin-plugin`'s `docs/warp-wake-chain.md`](https://github.com/ima-jin/openclaw-imajin-plugin/blob/main/docs/warp-wake-chain.md)
(PR #14). That document picks up at Hop 4 (the plugin's WS receive) and traces
forward to the agent turn; this one starts at the Warp platform and traces
forward to the WebSocket frame the plugin receives, so the two meet exactly at
the WS boundary (`ws-server.js`'s `sendToDid`) without overlap.

Citations are `ima-jin/imajin-ai` at `main`, after PR #2033 (merged
2026-09-05T21:26:40Z, "fix(warp): run lifecycle — timeout is not terminal,
resumed runs re-observed"), which is itself the fix for #2032. Prod ran #2033
from ~18:10 EDT 2026-09-05.

## Hop 1 — Kernel observes the run

Two kernel-side pollers exist, both funnelling through the same three publish
functions:

- **In-request watch** — `dispatchAgentRun` fires `watchRun` fire-and-forget
  right after the dispatch route responds 201
  (`apps/kernel/app/warp/api/dispatch/route.ts:214`, `void watchRun(...)` —
  deliberately un-awaited so a 30-minute watch never turns a 201 into a
  timeout). `watchRun` (`dispatch.ts:2235`) calls `pollUntilTerminal`
  (`dispatch.ts:1930`), polling on `WATCH_POLL_INTERVALS_MS`
  (`dispatch.ts:1426`, `[5s, 10s, 30s, 60s]` then held) up to `WATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`
  (`dispatch.ts:1429`, 30 minutes).
- **Scheduled sweep** — `sweepInFlightWarpRuns` (`run-watch-sweep.ts:366`),
  invoked from `GET /api/cron/warp-run-watch` on a 10-minute cron tick
  (`apps/kernel/vercel.json`). It lists every run whose latest
  `warp.agent.dispatched`/`warp.run.resumed` activity is newer than its
  latest terminal row (`listInFlightRuns`, `run-watch-sweep.ts:169`) and
  re-checks each one (`checkOneRun`, `run-watch-sweep.ts:318`).

**Outcome on success**, from either poller, is one of:
- `publishTerminalRunOutcome` (`dispatch.ts:2124`) → `warp.run.completed` or
  `warp.run.failed`.
- `publishBlockedRunOutcome` (`dispatch.ts:2141`) → `warp.run.blocked`.
- In-request watch only: `publishRunStillRunning` (`dispatch.ts:2183`) →
  `warp.run.still_running` when its own 30-minute budget elapses with Warp
  still non-terminal (`watchRun`'s `outcome.kind === 'timeout'` branch,
  `dispatch.ts:2259-2271` — the branch name is a leftover from before #2032;
  it is explicitly **not** a timeout publish any more).
- Sweep only: `publishTimeoutRunOutcome` (`dispatch.ts:2155`) →
  `warp.run.timeout`, reserved for a candidate whose `activityAt` is older
  than `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_MS` (`run-watch-sweep.ts:97`, 6 hours) and still
  non-terminal/non-BLOCKED on that read (`checkOneRun`,
  `run-watch-sweep.ts:342-349`).
- `sendFollowup`'s `resume: true` path (`dispatch.ts:1339`) publishes
  `warp.run.resumed` (via `publishRunResumed`, `dispatch.ts:1284`) when a
  terminal run is handed off to Warp's cloud-to-cloud resume. This is a
  distinct, third trigger — not a poller — but it is what makes a resumed
  segment visible to the sweep at all (its `previousSessionId` is what the
  sweep's segment-aware query reads back, `run-watch-sweep.ts:193-200`).

**`warp.run.timeout` has exactly one emitter in the whole kernel**:
`publishTimeoutRunOutcome`, called from exactly one call site
(`run-watch-sweep.ts:347`), gated on `ageMs > lookbackMs`
(`run-watch-sweep.ts:342-343`, default 6 hours). Verified by
`git grep -n "warp.run.timeout"` across `apps/kernel` and `packages` — see
"Incidents 2026-09-05" (a) below for why this matters.

**Grep:**
```
"Warp cloud agent run reached a terminal state"                              — dispatch.ts:2253
"Warp run watch budget elapsed while the run is still going"                 — dispatch.ts:2269
"Warp run watch sweep: could not list in-flight runs"                        — run-watch-sweep.ts:376
"Warp run watch sweep: could not check run"                                  — run-watch-sweep.ts:389
```

## Hop 2 — `publish()` fans the event out

`packages/bus/src/publish.ts:9` does two things for every event, in order:

1. **`deliverToSubscribers`** (`packages/bus/src/subscriptions.ts:108`),
   fire-and-forget, unconditionally. First writes a durable row to
   `kernel.event_subscription_log` for any event type at least one grant
   scope could entitle (`subscriptions.ts:120-133`) — **this durable write is
   what backs Hop 1's sweep query**, independent of whether any live
   subscriber is connected. Then resolves active grants and pushes a
   `bus_event`-typed WS frame to each entitled external agent
   (`subscriptions.ts:181-207`). The openclaw-imajin-plugin does not consume
   `bus_event` frames (its `dispatchFrame` only special-cases `notification`
   and `chat_message`); this leg only matters here because of the durable
   write.
   - Entitlement is `packages/auth/src/grant-scopes.ts:27`'s
     `warp:dispatch` scope's `eventTypes` list. #2032 found
     `warp.run.resumed` (and added `warp.run.still_running`) missing from
     this list — without it, `capabilities.length === 0` at
     `subscriptions.ts:112` takes the fast-path return and **no durable row
     is ever written**, which is the root cause #2033 fixed for "resumed
     runs never re-observed" (a completely separate bug from anything WS-push
     related).
2. **The configured reactor chain** (`packages/bus/src/config.ts` DEFAULTS,
   replaced wholesale by a `kernel.bus_chain_configs` row if one exists — see
   the comment at `config.ts:318`). Current `warp.run.*` chains:

   | Event | Reactors |
   |---|---|
   | `warp.run.completed` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:320-327`) |
   | `warp.run.failed` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:354-361`) |
   | `warp.run.blocked` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:362-369`) |
   | `warp.run.timeout` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:328-335`) |
   | `warp.run.still_running` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:345-348`, added by #2032) |
   | `warp.run.resumed` | `emit` + `notify` (`config.ts:340`, added by #2032 — previously no chain at all) |
   | `warp.run.progress` | `emit` only (`config.ts:379-381` — telemetry-class, #1805) |

   None of these reactors are `await: true` (`publish.ts:64-70`), so a
   `notify` failure here is logged (`publish.ts:68`) and never blocks or
   fails the call that published the event.

## Hop 3 — `notify` reactor → notification row + WS push

`notifyReactor` (`packages/bus/src/reactors/notify.ts:44`) interpolates the
configured `title`/`body` and calls `@imajin/notify`'s `send()`, which POSTs
to `POST /notify/api/send` (`apps/kernel/app/notify/api/send/route.ts:128`).
That handler, per request:
1. Inserts a row into `notify.notifications` (`route.ts:178-189`,
   `read: false`).
2. If the recipient's `inapp` preference is on (default on,
   `route.ts:169-170`), calls `pushNotificationToDid`
   (`src/lib/notify/ws-push.ts:83`) and records whether it actually reached a
   socket in `channelsSent` (`route.ts:196-221`).

`pushNotificationToDid` POSTs to the internal `/chat/api/internal/did-push`
route, handled by `ws-server.js`'s `setupBroadcastRoute`
(`ws-server.js:399-430`), which calls `sendToDid` (`ws-server.js:347`) — this
is the exact function `openclaw-imajin-plugin`'s wake-chain doc picks up from
on the other side. `sendToDid` sends to every open socket for the DID plus
any delegate registered via `register_also` (`ws-server.js:230-233`,
`also-registry.js`), and reports whether at least one socket was live.

**There is no server-side redelivery/"sweep" of missed WS pushes.** A push
that finds nobody connected (`sendToDid` returns `false`) is a dead end on
the kernel side beyond the persisted row: `GET /notify/api/notifications`
(`apps/kernel/app/notify/api/notifications/route.ts`) and
`GET /notify/api/notifications/unread` exist for a client to poll, but
`openclaw-imajin-plugin` never calls either (confirmed by
`git grep -n "notifications\|/notify/" src` in that repo returning no REST
call sites) — it is WS-push-or-nothing today. See "Incidents 2026-09-05" (a)
and (b) below.

**Grep:** `"Notification WS push failed"` / `"Notification WS push error"`
(`ws-push.ts:103,116` after this PR's fix — previously `:91,98`); the new
`"Notification WS push found no connected socket for recipient"`
(`ws-push.ts:110-113`).

## Incidents 2026-09-05

### (a) 19:09:01 `warp.run.timeout` for a run only ~45 minutes old

**Kernel is clean here.** `warp.run.timeout` has exactly one emitter in the
kernel (`publishTimeoutRunOutcome`, `dispatch.ts:2155`), called from exactly
one site (`run-watch-sweep.ts:347`), which only fires when
`ageMs > lookbackMs` — `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_MS` is 6 hours
(`run-watch-sweep.ts:97`). A run ~45 minutes past its dispatch/resume
activity cannot reach that branch: `checkOneRun` (`run-watch-sweep.ts:318`)
would classify it as `stillInFlight` (if `INPROGRESS`/`QUEUED`) long before
the age check, and the in-request watch's own 30-minute-budget branch
publishes `warp.run.still_running`, never `warp.run.timeout`
(`dispatch.ts:2259-2271`) — that rename is the entire point of #2033.

There is also no kernel-side mechanism that could re-deliver a **stale**
pre-#2033 `warp.run.timeout` notification row at 19:09:01: there is no
redelivery-on-reconnect job anywhere in the kernel (see Hop 3 above — no cron
in `vercel.json` touches `notify.notifications`, and `ws-server.js`'s
connection handler pushes nothing on connect, only `{type: 'connected'}` /
`{type: 'auth_required'}`, `ws-server.js:257,263,278`). If a genuinely
pre-#2033 timeout notification existed as an unread row, the only way it
reaches the plugin at 19:09:01 is the plugin itself reading it back — which,
per Hop 3, it has no code path to do. So there is neither (i) a second
kernel-side timeout emitter #2033 missed, nor (ii) a kernel-side sweep that
re-delivers unacked notification rows.

This is consistent with `openclaw-imajin-plugin` PR #14's own conclusion for
the same timestamp: the `19:09:01` lines it traced are `createNotificationInjector`'s
one-time startup banner (printed on plugin/gateway restart, listing
*configured* `injectScopes` — `warp.run.timeout` included because that scope
is configured to wake the agent, not because a timeout notification arrived
then) — a plugin-side log-format artifact, not a live WS frame. Nothing on
the kernel side contradicts that; if anything, the kernel evidence here
(single emitter, 6-hour gate, no redelivery path) independently rules out
the alternative "genuine kernel event" explanation the task raised.
**No fix applied for (a)** — there was no kernel defect to fix.

### (b) Two completions (18:58, 19:03) that did not push live

Two real, independent gaps found in Hop 3, both fixed in this PR:

1. **The "nobody connected" branch was completely silent.**
   `pushNotificationToDid` (`ws-push.ts`) logged `error` when the internal
   route returned non-2xx or the fetch itself threw, but when the route
   responded 200 with `{ delivered: false }` (i.e. `sendToDid` found no open
   socket for the recipient DID) — the single most likely explanation for a
   completion notification that "did not push live" while the row was
   written fine — **nothing was logged at all**. Fixed: that branch now logs
   a `warn` (`ws-push.ts:109-113`), so a future incident shows up in a plain
   log grep instead of requiring a database query to reconstruct.
2. **No aggregate visibility.** Even with logs, an operator had no
   single place to see "how many live pushes have missed recently" without
   grepping every kernel instance's logs. `GET /notify/api/health`
   (`apps/kernel/app/notify/api/health/route.ts`) now reports
   `recentWsPushMisses`: a count, over the last hour, of notifications where
   the in-app channel was eligible but `channelsSent` never gained `ws`
   (`route.ts:31-49`) — derived from the `notifications` row Hop 3 already
   writes, no new table or service. The count query degrades to omitting the
   field (never failing the health check) if the DB read itself has trouble.

Whether the specific 18:58/19:03 misses were "nobody connected" (WS
briefly down) or something else is not fully reconstructable from source
alone — that is exactly what these two fixes are for going forward. Reactor
ordering was checked and ruled out as a contributing cause: `notify` is not
`await: true` for `warp.run.completed` (`config.ts:320-327`,
`publish.ts:64-70`), so it never blocks or is blocked by anything else in the
chain; the two completions running through the same, single-purpose `notify`
call path as every other `warp.run.completed` rules out ordering as a
distinguishing factor between a push that lands and one that doesn't.

### (c) Resumed run at 16:15 producing no second `warp.run.completed` — and a related dupe risk

**The original #2032 bug (no completion at all for a resumed segment) is
fixed by #2033** and is exercised directly by
`run-watch-sweep.test.ts`'s "is visible to the sweep again even though its
first segment already completed" test
(`apps/kernel/src/lib/warp/__tests__/run-watch-sweep.test.ts:367-381`):
`listInFlightRuns`'s timestamp comparison (latest dispatch-or-resume activity
vs. latest terminal row, `run-watch-sweep.ts:221-222`) makes a resumed
segment visible to the sweep again even though the run's first segment
already has a `warp.run.completed` row, and `resumeContextFor`
(`run-watch-sweep.ts:265-268`) attaches `resumedFrom`/`segment` to that
segment's own completion.

**Auditing this further surfaced a real, separate defect**: neither
`watchRun`'s terminal branch (`dispatch.ts:2244-2256`) nor the sweep's
`checkOneRun` (pre-fix) checked whether the *other* poller had already
published a terminal outcome for the same run before publishing their own.
A fresh (non-resumed) run dispatched via `POST /warp/api/dispatch` starts an
in-request `watchRun` that can stay alive for up to 30 minutes
(`dispatch.ts:214`, `WATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`), while the sweep independently
re-checks every in-flight run every 10 minutes
(`apps/kernel/vercel.json`). Any run that survives past one sweep tick while
still being watched in-request — common for anything longer than a couple of
minutes — has a real window where both the watch's poll and a sweep tick can
call `getAgentRun`, both observe the same terminal state, and both call
`publishTerminalRunOutcome`/`publishTimeoutRunOutcome`, producing **two**
`warp.run.completed` (or `.failed`/`.timeout`) events for one run — a real
duplicate notification and, per the plugin's own wake chain, a real
duplicate agent wake. (Resumed segments were not at risk of this specific
race: `sendFollowup`'s resume path, `dispatch.ts:1339-1393`, never starts an
in-request watch, so only the sweep ever observes a resumed segment.)

**Fixed in this PR**, inside the existing pattern
(`hasPublishedBlockedNotice`, `run-watch-sweep.ts:252-262`, already re-checks
the durable log immediately before publishing to avoid re-notifying a known
BLOCKED run): a new `hasTerminalEventForSegment` guard
(`run-watch-sweep.ts:291-302`) re-checks `kernel.event_subscription_log` for
a terminal row at-or-after the candidate's `activityAt` (i.e. for *this*
segment specifically, so an older segment's terminal row never blocks a
resumed segment's own completion) immediately before the sweep's
`checkOneRun` calls `publishTerminalRunOutcome` or
`publishTimeoutRunOutcome`. A skip is counted in the new `SweepOutcome.skippedRace`
field rather than `completed`/`failed`/`timedOut`, since nothing was
published. This narrows the race to the (much smaller, and in production
effectively negligible given the poll cadences involved) reverse window
where the in-request watch could publish moments after a sweep tick has
already read but not yet published — closing it fully would need a
DB-level lock or unique constraint, which is out of scope for a minimal fix
(see "Follow-ups" below) but the common, most-likely-to-actually-fire
direction (sweep racing an in-request watch that has been running for
several minutes) is closed.

Regression tests added:
- `run-watch-sweep.test.ts` → describe block "race with the in-request
  watch": a candidate with a pre-existing terminal row at-or-after its
  `activityAt` is skipped, not double-published, for both the terminal and
  timeout paths; a legitimately-resumed segment with no such row still
  publishes normally.
- `watch-run.test.ts`'s existing "(#2032 acceptance)" test already pins
  exactly one `warp.run.completed` and zero `warp.run.timeout` across a
  still-running-then-succeeded sequence.

### (d) 22:24:56 completion tonight — kernel's responsibility ends at the WS frame

For an ordinary (non-resumed, non-stale) run reaching `SUCCEEDED`, the
in-request watch publishes exactly one `warp.run.completed`
(`dispatch.ts:2255`, `publishTerminalRunOutcome` with no `resumeContext`),
which Hop 2/3 turns into one `notifications` row and one immediate WS push
attempt (`route.ts:200-204`) — no batching, no delay, no queue on the kernel
side between "run observed terminal" and "push attempted". The plugin's own
receipt nine seconds later (22:25:05) is consistent with that being a single,
immediate live push rather than anything queued.

The kernel's responsibility ends at the WS frame leaving `sendToDid`
(`ws-server.js:347`) successfully — i.e. at the exact point
`openclaw-imajin-plugin`'s wake-chain doc picks up (its Hop 4, WS receive).
The 22:30 failure (a reserved `:` in a cron tag rejecting the scheduled wake
turn) is entirely inside `openclaw-imajin-plugin`/openclaw-core's Hop 6/7
(`schedulePluginSessionTurn`'s tag validation) — not investigated further
here, per scope.

## Follow-ups filed (out of scope for this PR)

- [#2043](https://github.com/ima-jin/imajin-ai/issues/2043) — closing the
  remaining (smaller) direction of the (c) race: sweep publishing, then the
  in-request watch independently publishing moments later for the same
  segment. Needs either a DB-level uniqueness constraint on
  `(runId, segment)` for terminal `event_subscription_log` rows or an
  advisory lock around the read-then-publish sequence in both `watchRun` and
  the sweep. That is a schema/architecture change (`dispatch.ts` currently
  has no DB dependency at all — see its module doc), so it is filed
  separately rather than folded into this minimal fix.
- [#2044](https://github.com/ima-jin/imajin-ai/issues/2044) — the plugin has
  no client-side catch-up read of `GET /notify/api/notifications`/`/unread`
  at all (Hop 3 above) — a missed live push today is invisible to the agent
  until a human happens to check the `/notify` page. Whether that catch-up
  belongs in the plugin (poll on reconnect) or the kernel (push a backlog on
  `{type: 'connected'}`) is a product decision for that repo/team, filed as
  a follow-up issue rather than guessed at here.
